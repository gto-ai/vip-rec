[action:high_five] My name is Alice, born in unitree and now work in ST engineering. Nice to meet you.
[action:right_hand_up] Today, I am delighted to share some of our recent work in embodied AI. Let us get started!
[action:conversation_gesture] May I direct your attention to the left, where my robot colleague Sky is picking up a toy cherry and placing it into the basket. 
[action:clap] Let us give him a round of applause. He has practiced hundreds of times to perfect the move.
[action:hands_up] You may want to know how he is able to do it. It is all thanks to our data factory and model training pipeline in embodied AI.
[action:open_gesture] My other colleages are helping Sky to collect data by teleoperate him to do so. Then the collected data are used to train his brain.
[action:neutral_gesture] With a smarter brain, Sky is able to do increasingly interesting things. You may want to keep an eye on him later this year.
[action:conversation_gesture] We also have robot dogs next door. You’re welcome to go check them out. Thank you for your listening.
[action:wave_hand] See you next time.
